A mount point in an operating system is a directory where a file system or storage device (like a hard drive or USB) is attached and made accessible. When a storage device is "mounted," its contents are available under the mount point directory.

For example, in Linux, the /mnt or /media directories are commonly used as mount points. The OS uses mount points to integrate external storage or network file systems into the existing file system hierarchy, allowing users to interact with them as regular directories.
