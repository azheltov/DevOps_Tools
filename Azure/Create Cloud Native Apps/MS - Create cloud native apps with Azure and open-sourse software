Module
7 Units
This module teaches concepts and ideas associated with cloud-native apps. We cover selecting Open-Source Software (OSS) components like Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, as well as unique Azure tools like Cosmos DB. We’ll also identify situations that call for building cloud-native apps, and review selecting components in an example scenario.
